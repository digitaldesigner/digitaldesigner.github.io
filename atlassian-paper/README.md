# Dropbox Paper > Confluence
Let's be honest, reading documents on Confluence is a painful experience. The line length, the typography... pretty much everything about it sucks. Things only get worse when you're used to using Dropbox Paper, which is a bloody delight. So I made some CSS styles that will bring some of that Paper magic to your dull Confluence world.

## How to use  
1. In Confluence Edit mode, add a new Full-width section
2. In the new section, hit the + icon, choose Other Macro > Style Macro (search for CSS)
3. In the Import field, paste `https://digitaldesigner.github.io/atlassian-paper/paper-confluence.css`

Note that the styles won't be visible until you Preview or Publish the page. There's nothing I can do to help style the editing view. God-speed.
