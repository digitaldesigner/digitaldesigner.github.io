# Dropbox Paper > Confluence
Let's be honest, reading documents on Confluence is a painful experience. The line length, the typography... pretty much everything about it sucks. Things only get worse when you're used to using Dropbox Paper, which is a bloody delight. So I made some CSS styles that will bring some of that Paper magic to your dull Confluence world.

## How to use  
1. In Confluence Edit mode, add a new Full-width section
2. In this new section, hit that + icon, choose Other Macro > Style Macro (search for CSS)
3. Paste the CSS from this Repo into the widget

Note that the styles won't be visible until you Preview or Publish the page. There's nothing I can do to help style the editing view. God-speed.
